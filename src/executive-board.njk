    <p>
      The SAOA Executive Board consists of both elected and ex officio members.
    </p>

    <p>
      Three representatives from SAOA members are elected to three-year terms by the members of SAMP. The terms of office for these elected members are staggered, so that one seat becomes open each year. Membership is limited to two consecutive terms. The current SAMP Chairperson (ex officio) and a representative from the Center for Research Libraries (non-voting ex officio) also serve on the board.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Executive Board selects a Chair from among its members for a two-year term; reappointment is permitted.
    </p>
