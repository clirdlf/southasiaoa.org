        Our outreach is aimed at the user community writ large, encompassing both current and future/potential users, and member and non-member institutions across the globe. In furthering the open access, decolonizing mission of SAOA, we have a particular commitment to reaching a diversity of scholars and institutions in South Asia, as well as non-elite and minority-serving institutions in the United States.
